It's the forth year I have been working on building iOS Apps. Through the journey there are plenty of tricky and interesting trifles I may be able to share with, now it's time for you guys to read my murmurs.

I start programming since I was twelve it was all about manipulating a custom map in StarCraft, the legendary game. Then I built my own website with a variety of fancy animations. I almost filled everything I could into the body block. It was disaster at all, but I learned the most important thing in programming "Never expect it will work as how you they told you on the book/internet".

Yes, I was a child who was fascinated by fancy animations. I changed my mind to Flash which is easier to do graphic animating. I was might to be a designer at that time, but in the end I became a software developer.
