# Standing on the shoulders of giants

Exemplary people excel at what they do and are excellent examples to others. There are three people who influenced me most in last year.

Kimie, a new colleague of Jink last year. She is a brilliant  

Meng, a friend who works in Germany.



# What I want to achieve in this year

### Practice English

To face your greatest fear is the first step towards to the success, and to me it is how to express the mindset in English either in speaking or writing. And I have been told to improve it after interview in serval times. I blame it on my personality which is trying to be perfect in any perspective. For instance when I am talking to someone, I am always thinking of to choose the best words for the context. This is usually not a good idea when you are lacking of vocabularies and practices. Therefore my challenges for this year will be focused on training myself to use English a lot.
